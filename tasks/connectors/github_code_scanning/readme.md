## Running the GitHub Code Scanning task 

This 128iid brings in data from GitHub code scanning alerts.

To run this task you need the following information from GitHub: 

1. GitHub username
2. GitHub token 
3. One or more repository names

**IMPORTANT: you must be an administrator for the repository or organization, and you must use an access token with the repo scope or security_events scope.
If GitHub 2FA is enabled, the access token MUST be configured for SSO. 
If the user is not an admin at the time of Key generation, you will need to promote the user to admin, and regenerate the key. **

## Command Line

See the main 128iid for instructions on running tasks. For this task, if you leave off the Kenna API Key and Kenna Connector ID, the task will create a json file in the default or specified output directory. You can review the file before attempting to upload to the Kenna directly.

Recommended Steps: 

1. Run with GitHub Keys only to ensure you are able to get data properly from the scanner
1. Review output for expected data
1. Create Kenna Data Importer connector in Kenna (example name: GitHub Code Scanning) 
1. Manually run the connector with the json from step 1 
1. Click on the name of the connector to get the connector id
1. Run the task with GitHub Keys and Kenna Key/connector id

**IMPORTANT: severity and security_severity are POST processing filters and will not reduce the amount of data pulled from GitHub
