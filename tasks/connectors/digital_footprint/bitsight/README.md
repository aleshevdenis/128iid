## Running Bitsight Digital Footprinting task 

This 128iid brings in data from the Bitsight by first retrieving the portfolio and thereby the company id: 
https://#{@bitsight_api_key}:@api.bitsighttech.com/portfolio

Then getting findings seen in the last 90 days for foreach company:
https://api.bitsighttech.com/ratings/v1/companies/#{@company_guid}/findings

To run this task you need the following information from Bitsight: 

1. API Key

## Command Line

See the main 128iid for instructions on running tasks. For this task, if you leave off the Kenna API Key and Kenna Connector ID, the task will create a json file in the default or specified output directory. You can review the file before attempting to upload to the Kenna directly.

Data can be limited using the bitsight_create_benign_findings parameter in conjuction with the bitsight_benign_finding_grades to define which grades are considered benign. 

Recommended Steps: 

1. Run with Bitsight Key only to ensure you are able to get data properly
1. Review output for expected data
1. Create Kenna Data Importer connector in Kenna (example name: Bitsight KDI) 
1. Manually run the connector with the json from step 1 
1. Click on the name of the connector to get the connector id
1. Run the task with Bitsight Keys and Kenna Key/connector id
