## Running the Netsparker task 

This 128iid brings in data from Netsparker

To run this task you need the following information from Netsparker: 

1. Netsparker api user
2. Netsparker api token
3. Schedule Id list

## Command Line

See the main 128iid for instructions on running tasks. For this task, if you leave off the Kenna API Key and Kenna Connector ID, the task will create a json file in the default or specified output directory. You can review the file before attempting to upload to the Kenna directly.

Recommended Steps: 

1. Run with Netsparker Keys only to ensure you are able to get data properly from the scanner
1. Review output for expected data
1. Create Kenna Data Importer connector in Kenna (example name: Netsparker KDI) 
1, Manually run the connector with the json from step 1 
1. Click on the name of the connector to get the connector id
1. Run the task with Netsparker Keys and Kenna Key/connector id
